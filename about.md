So this is it, a blog just about 15 years after blogs popped up for the first time. What's next, a Facebook account? Anyways. This is a personal blog to hold me accountable for elaborating on the ideas I have throughout the day, to document the things I read and learnt and the things I didn't but should. This will be either in English or in German oder gemischt, depending on what feels better. Feel free to skip the posts that don't interest you, it would be more than astonishing to me if there was anything of interest for the world public going on in my head. 

### More Information

I have been trying to figure out how life works for the past 34 years or so. I think I made some progress here and there, but most of mankind still remains a mystery to me. If you'd like to contact me, just comment on what I wrote.
